      My name is Omar, the owner and main operator of Dent Touch, LLC. I grew up working with my dad in his body shop spening a considerable amount of time around cars and auto repair. As I transitioned into my own career, I worked for a time as a technician doing collision repair before being given the opportunity to focus in on paintless dent repair (PDR). I started doing PDR in 2008 and have since worked on thousands of cars across the nation. While traveling is a great way to see the world, I've started Dent Touch, LLC. to bring my work back home to Dallas-Fort Worth allowing me to spend my weeknights at home with my wife and kids. If you have a dent you need removed, reach out to me. Reach out to us. We're here to take care of you.
